  <h1>// About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm Wiktor Wagan, 18 years old, stubborn and determined. When I want something, 
    I pursue it relentlessly. Being hard of hearing taught me focus, clarity, and resilience.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love <span class="highlight">math</span>, <span class="highlight">horror stories</span>, 
    and <span class="highlight">cats</span>. I learn quickly from my mistakes and turn challenges into growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m looking for a <span class="highlight">programming job</span>, any kind of coding work, 
    where I can learn, create, and contribute.
  </p>
